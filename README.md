Easy comparison of different map tile providers, using [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) as a wrapper around map APIs.  
The different providers showcased are Google, Bing, Esri (World Street Map), Cloudmade, MapQuest Open, OpenStreetMap.  
In order to see maps for Bing and Cloumade you need your own api keys (search for API_KEY in [LeafletView.js](static/js/LeafletView.js))

There's also an example of marker clustering, thanks to the [Leaflet.markercluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster) plugin.

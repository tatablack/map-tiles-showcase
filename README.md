Easy comparison of different map tile providers, using [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) as a wrapper around map APIs.  
The different providers showcased are Google, Bing, Esri (World Street Map), CloudMade, MapQuest-OSM, OpenStreetMap.  
In order to see maps for Bing and CloudMade you need your own api keys (search for API_KEY in [LeafletView.js](static/js/LeafletView.js))

There's also an example of marker clustering, thanks to the [Leaflet.markercluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster) plugin.
